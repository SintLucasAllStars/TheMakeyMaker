# TheMakeyMaker
Unity tools to experiment, create and visualize with Makey Makey for 1st year students.

# Installation
This project can be cloned from this repository or a release can be downloaded as a Unity Package from the releases page.
This package is built and tested on Unity version 2020.2.0b13 but should work on any relatively recent Unity release.

### Cloning
You can clone this repository and add the project to your Unity Hub.

### Using the release
Just download the latest release from the releases page, open a Unity project and double-click the package file. It will open the Unity import window as if you had downloaded it from the Asset Store.

This will create a `TheMakeyMaker` folder on your `Assets` folder and all the content will be there, ready for you to use.

# Contents
This package contains a few ready to use prefabs and tools to create small visualizations that react to MakeyMakey key events.
There are also a few ready to use scenes that use these tools so you can directly have some fun with and modify to your liking. These scenes are a great place to get started.
